SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG‼️

Learning description: I will make a fully functioning 2d game during this course. I am making this game with the intent to put it on the market. I have a paper prototype already made which I intend to test before coding anything. No code for this game has been written yet.

Roles: shockingly, nobody wanted to work on this game despite my pitch which was incredibly professional and not at all bizarre or deranged. This makes me the CEO of the shadow wizard money gang dev team. In terms of animal roles, I am a regular FurAffinity of Owl, Bear, Cat, Rabbit and Wolf combined.

Outcomes: I'll make a fun game, which is good enough to sell and make a profit from.
